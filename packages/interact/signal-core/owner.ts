/**
 * @module @in/teract/signal-core/owner
 *
 * This module provides ownership tracking for reactive scopes, enabling nested tracking
 * scopes with automatic cleanup. Think of it like a company's organizational chart where
 * each manager (owner) is responsible for their team members (child computations) and
 * can delegate responsibilities while maintaining clear hierarchical accountability.
 *
 * Owner tracking is used to enable nested tracking scopes with automatic cleanup.
 * We also use owners to keep track of which error handling context we are in.
 *
 * @example Basic Owner Tree Structure
 * ```typescript
 * import { createRoot } from "@in/teract/signal-core/create-root.ts";
 *
 * // Creates a tree structure like:
 * //    a
 * //   /|\
 * //  b-c-e
 * //    |
 * //    d
 *
 * const a = createRoot(() => {
 *   const b = createRoot(() => {});
 *   const c = createRoot(() => {
 *     const d = createRoot(() => {});
 *   });
 *   const e = createRoot(() => {});
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @features
 * - **Hierarchical Scope Management**: Organize reactive computations in a tree structure
 * - **Automatic Cleanup**: When a parent scope is disposed, all children are automatically cleaned up
 * - **Context Propagation**: Context values flow from parent to child scopes
 * - **Error Handling**: Error handlers are inherited and can be overridden at different levels
 * - **Resource Management**: Track disposable resources and ensure proper cleanup
 * - **Scope Isolation**: Each owner maintains its own context and disposal mechanisms
 * - **Queue Management**: Each scope can have its own execution queue for effects
 * - **Tree Traversal**: Efficient sibling and parent navigation through linked list structure
 * - **Lifecycle Management**: Track the state of each scope (clean, disposed, etc.)
 *
 * @example Advanced Owner Management
 * ```typescript
 * import { createRoot, getOwner, setOwner } from "@in/teract/signal-core";
 *
 * // Create a root scope with error handling
 * createRoot(() => {
 *   const owner = getOwner();
 *   console.log("Current owner:", owner);
 *
 *   // Child scope inherits context
 *   createRoot(() => {
 *     const childOwner = getOwner();
 *     console.log("Child owner parent:", childOwner._parent === owner);
 *   });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Owner Context and Error Handling
 * ```typescript
 * // Error handling propagation through owner tree
 * createRoot(() => {
 *   const owner = getOwner();
 *
 *   // Set up error handler for this scope and all children
 *   owner._handlers = [(error, owner) => {
 *     console.log("Caught error in scope:", error);
 *   }];
 *
 *   createRoot(() => {
 *     // This child inherits the error handler
 *     throw new Error("Child error"); // Will be caught by parent handler
 *   });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Cleanup and Resource Management
 * ```typescript
 * import { onCleanup } from "@in/teract/signal-core/on-cleanup.ts";
 *
 * createRoot((dispose) => {
 *   // Register cleanup functions
 *   onCleanup(() => console.log("Cleaning up resource 1"));
 *   onCleanup(() => console.log("Cleaning up resource 2"));
 *
 *   createRoot(() => {
 *     onCleanup(() => console.log("Child cleanup"));
 *   });
 *
 *   // When dispose() is called, all cleanups run in reverse order
 *   setTimeout(dispose, 1000);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Custom Owner Management
 * ```typescript
 * // Advanced scope management with custom contexts
 * createRoot(() => {
 *   const owner = getOwner();
 *
 *   // Set custom context for this scope
 *   owner._context = {
 *     ...owner._context,
 *     theme: "dark",
 *     user: { id: 123, name: "Ben" }
 *   };
 *
 *   createRoot(() => {
 *     // Child automatically inherits parent context
 *     const childOwner = getOwner();
 *     console.log(childOwner._context.theme); // "dark"
 *     console.log(childOwner._context.user.name); // "Ben"
 *   });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @apiOptions
 * - signal: boolean - Whether to create a signal-only owner (doesn't auto-append to current)
 * - context: ContextRecordType - Custom context object for the owner
 * - handlers: ErrorHandlerType[] - Error handlers for this scope
 * - queue: IQueueType - Custom execution queue for effects
 * - disposal: DisposableType[] - Cleanup functions to run on disposal
 *
 * @bestPractices
 * 1. Always create reactive computations within a root scope for proper cleanup
 * 2. Use nested scopes to isolate resources and provide logical grouping
 * 3. Set up error handlers at appropriate levels in the owner hierarchy
 * 4. Register cleanup functions for any resources that need explicit disposal
 * 5. Avoid manual owner manipulation unless building advanced reactive primitives
 *
 * @see {@link createRoot} - Creates a new reactive scope with an owner
 * @see {@link onCleanup} - Registers cleanup functions with the current owner
 * @see {@link createContext} - Uses owner tree for context value lookup
 * @see {@link createEffect} - Effects are owned and cleaned up automatically

 * ```
 *
 * #### Examples
 *
 * @example
 * ### Example 1: Basic Owner Access
 * ```typescript
 * import { createRoot, getOwner } from "@in/teract/signal-core";
 *
 * // Outside any scope
 * console.log(getOwner()); // null
 *
 * createRoot(() => {
 *   // Inside a reactive scope
 *   const owner = getOwner();
 *   console.log(owner !== null); // true
 *   console.log(owner instanceof OwnerClass); // true
 *
 *   // Check owner properties
 *   console.log("Owner state:", owner._state);
 *   console.log("Has parent:", owner._parent !== null);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ### Example 2: Advanced Owner Inspection
 * ```typescript
 * import { createRoot, getOwner, createEffect } from "@in/teract/signal-core";
 *
 * createRoot(() => {
 *   const rootOwner = getOwner();
 *   console.log("Root owner context:", rootOwner._context);
 *
 *   createRoot(() => {
 *     const childOwner = getOwner();
 *     console.log("Child owner parent:", childOwner._parent === rootOwner); // true
 *     console.log("Context inherited:", childOwner._context !== rootOwner._context); // true but values copied
 *
 *     createEffect(() => {
 *       const effectOwner = getOwner();
 *       console.log("Effect runs in child scope:", effectOwner === childOwner); // true
 *
 *       // Owner provides context for error handling, cleanup, etc.
 *       if (effectOwner._handlers) {
 *         console.log("Error handlers available:", effectOwner._handlers.length);
 *       }
 *     });
 *   });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @returns {OwnerClass | null} The currently executing owner scope, or null if called
 * outside any reactive context. Think of this as your "employee badge" that shows
 * which department (scope) you're currently working in.
 *
 * ### üìù Uncommon Knowledge
 * getOwner() returns the same owner instance throughout a single reactive execution,
 * but the owner can change between different reactive computations. This means you
 * can safely cache the owner within a single computation, but shouldn't cache it
 * across different reactive boundaries.

 * # SetOwner
 * @summary #### Changes the currently active reactive owner scope and returns the previous one
 *
 * Think of `setOwner` like handing the "manager in charge" badge to someone else in an organization.
 * You take the badge from the current manager, give it to a new manager, and get back information
 * about who was previously in charge. This allows you to temporarily change who's responsible
 * for new work, then restore the original manager later.

 *
 * ### üìù Uncommon Knowledge
 * setOwner is primarily used internally by reactive primitives to ensure computations
 * are created under the correct owner. For example, when a createEffect runs, it
 * temporarily sets itself as the owner so any nested computations are properly
 * managed by the effect's lifecycle.

/**
 * # OwnerClass
 * @summary #### Manages reactive scopes, cleanup, context, and error handling in a hierarchical structure
 *
 * Think of `OwnerClass` like a department manager in a large corporation. Each manager (owner)
 * is responsible for their team members (reactive computations), maintains their own budget and
 * resources (context), handles team problems (error handling), and ensures proper cleanup when
 * the department is reorganized or closed down.
 *
 * The owner system creates a tree structure where each owner can have children (sub-departments)
 * and siblings (peer departments), enabling organized resource management and automatic cleanup
 * when portions of the reactive system are no longer needed.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
 * @category Interact - (InSpatial Signal Core)
 * @module Owner
 * @kind class
 * @access public
 *
 * ### üí° Core Concepts
 * - **Hierarchical Management**: Organizes reactive computations in a tree structure
 * - **Automatic Cleanup**: When disposed, all child owners and computations are cleaned up
 * - **Context Inheritance**: Child owners inherit parent context but can override values
 * - **Error Propagation**: Error handlers flow from parent to child with override capabilities
 * - **Resource Tracking**: Maintains disposal functions for proper resource management
 * - **Queue Management**: Each owner can have its own execution queue for effects
 *
 * ### üéØ Prerequisites
 * Before working with owners:
 * - Understanding of reactive programming concepts
 * - Knowledge of hierarchical data structures
 * - Familiarity with resource management patterns
 * - Basic understanding of error handling strategies
 *
 * ### üìö Terminology
 * > **Owner Tree**: The hierarchical structure of reactive scopes
 * > **Disposal**: The process of cleaning up an owner and its resources
 * > **Context Inheritance**: How child scopes receive parent values
 * > **Error Boundary**: An owner that handles errors from its children
 * > **Sibling Linkage**: How peer owners are connected in the tree structure

 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 * > Owners form a flattened linked list for efficient traversal
 *

 *
 * ### üéÆ Usage
 * #### Installation
 * ```bash
 * # Deno
 * deno add jsr:@in/teract
 * ```
 *
 * #### Examples
 *
 * @example
 * ### Example 1: Basic Owner Lifecycle
 * ```typescript
 * import { OwnerClass, setOwner } from "@in/teract/signal-core";
 * import { onCleanup } from "@in/teract/signal-core/on-cleanup.ts";
 *
 * // Create a root owner manually
 * const rootOwner = new OwnerClass(true); // true = signal owner, doesn't auto-append

 * ### Example 2: Advanced Context and Error Handling
 * ```typescript
 * import { OwnerClass, setOwner } from "@in/teract/signal-core";
 *
 * // Create owner with custom context
 * const appOwner = new OwnerClass(true);
 * appOwner._context = {
 *   theme: "dark",
 *   user: { id: 123, name: "Ben" },
 *   permissions: ["read", "write"]
 * };
 *
 * // Set up error handling
 * appOwner._handlers = [(error, owner) => {
 *   console.log(`Error in ${owner === appOwner ? 'app' : 'child'} scope:`, error.message);
 *   // Handle error gracefully
 * }];
 *
 * const prevOwner = setOwner(appOwner);
 *
 * try {
 *   // Create child that inherits context and error handling
 *   const featureOwner = new OwnerClass();
 *   console.log("Inherited theme:", featureOwner._context.theme); // "dark"
 *   console.log("Has error handlers:", featureOwner._handlers.length > 0); // true
 *
 *   // Override context in child
 *   featureOwner._context = {
 *     ...featureOwner._context,
 *     theme: "light", // Override parent theme
 *     feature: "dashboard" // Add new context
 *   };
 *
 *   setOwner(featureOwner);
 *
 *   // Simulate error that gets caught by parent handler
 *   try {

 *   } catch (error) {
 *     featureOwner.handleError(error); // Propagates to app owner handler
 *   }
 *
 * } finally {
 *   appOwner.dispose();
 *   setOwner(prevOwner);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### ‚ö° Performance Tips
 * <details>
 * <summary>Click to learn about performance</summary>
 *
 * - Owners use a flattened linked list structure for efficient traversal
 * - Children are stored in reverse order to optimize append operations
 * - Context objects are shallow-copied to balance inheritance and isolation
 * - Disposal processes children iteratively to avoid stack overflow
 * </details>
 *
 * ### ‚ùå Common Mistakes
 * <details>
 * <summary>Click to see what to avoid</summary>
 *
 * - **Manual owner creation**: Use createRoot instead for most cases
 * - **Forgetting disposal**: Always dispose owners to prevent memory leaks
 * - **Context mutation**: Don't modify inherited context directly, create new objects
 * - **Missing error handlers**: Set up error boundaries at appropriate levels
 * </details>
 *
 * @throws {Error} Any unhandled errors from child computations or disposal functions
 *
 * ### üìù Uncommon Knowledge
 * The owner tree is "largely orthogonal to the reactivity tree" - this means
 * the owner hierarchy (who manages whom) is separate from the dependency graph
 * (who depends on whom). An effect might be owned by one scope but depend on
 * signals from completely different scopes.

/**
 * # NoOwnerErrorClass
 * @summary #### Indicates an operation requiring a reactive owner was called outside any reactive scope
 *
 * Think of `NoOwnerErrorClass` like a security system that alerts you when someone tries to use
 * company equipment without being logged into the system. Certain operations in the reactive
 * system need to know "who's in charge" (which owner scope is active) to work properly.
 * When these operations are called outside any reactive scope, this error is thrown.
 *
 * This commonly happens when you try to create reactive computations or access context
 * outside of a `createRoot` scope, similar to trying to use a hotel key card when you
 * haven't checked into any room.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
 * @category Interact - (InSpatial Signal Core)
 * @module Owner
 * @kind class
 * @access public
 * @extends Error
 *
 * ### üí° Core Concepts
 * - Signals operations that require a reactive scope but were called without one
 * - Helps developers identify when reactive APIs are used incorrectly
 * - Provides clear error messages to guide proper usage
 * - Prevents undefined behavior in the reactive system
 *
 * ### üéØ Prerequisites
 * Before working with this error:
 * - Understanding of reactive scopes and when they're active
 * - Knowledge of which operations require reactive contexts
 * - Familiarity with createRoot and other scope-creating functions
 *
 * ### üìö Terminology
 * > **Reactive Scope**: An active context where reactive operations can safely execute
 * > **Owner Requirement**: When an operation needs a scope to manage its lifecycle
 * > **Context Access**: Operations that need to look up values in the owner tree
 *
 * ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
 * <details>
 * <summary>Click to learn more about this error</summary>
 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 * > Most commonly occurs with onCleanup, getContext, and similar functions
 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 * > Can be resolved by wrapping code in createRoot or similar scope creators
 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 * > The error message includes helpful details in development mode
 * </details>
 *
 * ### üéÆ Usage
 *
 * @example
 * ### Example 1: Common Error Scenario
 * ```typescript
 * import { onCleanup } from "@in/teract/signal-core/on-cleanup.ts";
 * import { createRoot } from "@in/teract/signal-core/create-root.ts";
 *
 * // ‚ùå This will throw NoOwnerErrorClass
 * try {
 *   onCleanup(() => console.log("cleanup"));
 * } catch (error) {
 *   console.log(error instanceof NoOwnerErrorClass); // true
 *   console.log(error.message); // "Context can only be accessed under a reactive root."
 * }
 *
 * // ‚úÖ This works correctly
 * createRoot(() => {
 *   onCleanup(() => console.log("cleanup")); // No error
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ### Example 2: Context Access Error
 * ```typescript
 * import { createContext, getContext, setContext } from "@in/teract/signal-core/create-context.ts";
 *
 * const ThemeContext = createContext("light");
 *
 * // ‚ùå This will throw NoOwnerErrorClass
 * try {
 *   const theme = getContext(ThemeContext);
 * } catch (error) {
 *   console.log("Cannot access context outside reactive scope");
 *   console.log(error instanceof NoOwnerErrorClass); // true
 * }
 *
 * // ‚úÖ This works correctly
 * createRoot(() => {
 *   setContext(ThemeContext, "dark");
 *   const theme = getContext(ThemeContext); // No error
 *   console.log(theme); // "dark"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### ‚ùå Common Mistakes
 * <details>
 * <summary>Click to see what causes this error</summary>
 *
 * - **Top-level reactive calls**: Calling onCleanup, getContext outside any scope
 * - **Async boundary crossing**: Calling reactive APIs from setTimeout/Promise callbacks
 * - **Event handler issues**: Using reactive APIs in event handlers without proper scope
 * - **Module initialization**: Trying to create reactive state during module loading
 * </details>
 *
 * @throws {NoOwnerErrorClass} When the error is created and thrown
 *
 * ### üìù Uncommon Knowledge
 * This error is actually a feature, not a bug. It prevents silent failures and
 * undefined behavior that would occur if reactive operations were allowed to
 * execute without proper lifecycle management. The error forces you to think
 * about scope and ownership, leading to more robust applications.
 *
 * ### üîß Runtime Support

 * - ‚úÖ Deno
