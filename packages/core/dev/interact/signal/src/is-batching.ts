/**
 * `batch` allows changes made inside `fn` to be queued and flushed once, rather than
 * triggering intermediate reactive updates.  It simply increments an internal
 * depth counter; when depth returns to 0 we flush the global queue synchronously.
 * This mirrors SolidJS semantics sufficiently for our core tests.
 *
 * NOTE:  All internals already enqueue into `globalQueue`, so batching only needs
 * to defer the final `flush` until the outer‚Äêmost batch completes.
