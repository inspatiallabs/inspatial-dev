## üöÄ Features

- InSpatial's new default styling primitives and variables
- Seamless integration with InSpatial apps or any Tailwind CSS project
- Optimized for spatial computing and cross-platform development
- Inspired by [default Tailwind configuration](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/main/stubs/config.full.js)

## üì¶ Install InSpatial Tailwind Config

```bash
deno add jsr:@inspatial/tailwind-config tailwindcss
```

---

## üîß Usage

Extend your `tailwind.config.ts` file with InSpatial's custom configuration:

```ts
const inSpatialTailwindConfig = require("@inspatial/tailwind-config");

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  presets: [inSpatialTailwindConfig],
  // Optional: Add project specific configurations e.g
  // content: [],
  // theme: {
  //   extend: {},
  // },
  // ... more configurations
};
```

## üìö Documentation

## Good to know

Adding the following configuration values will override InSpatial's Tailwind Config default ones.

#### - `content`

By default InSpatial takes a primitive guess at what you might want to include in your content array, however it is recommended that you override this by providing your own content array based on prroject structure and framework. Here's an example of what this might look like if you are using Next.js or similar framework:

```js
content: [
  "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
];
```

**NOTE:** Do not overide if you are using InSpatial Run, as it will be populated with the correct paths for your project.

---

Other configuration values are optional, however if you do provide them they will not override InSpatial's defaults but will extend them e.g

#### - `separator`

#### - `blocklist`

#### - `corePlugins`

#### - `safelist`

#### - `prefix`

etc...

#### - `theme`

Theme is multi-faceted because you can override as well as extend InSpatial's defaults.


**Recommended:** Put your theme configurations inside the extend attribute it will add your configurations to InSpatial's defaults without overidding them which is what we you want to do in most cases.

```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    // Your configurations here
  }
}
```

**Overriding (Not Recommended):** You can overide InSpatial's defaults by passing your values directly inside the theme: {} attribute in your theme config - which will result in InSpatial's defaults being overridden.

```js
theme: {
  // Your configurations here
}
```

**Note**: You probably don't want to override the theme seeing as this particular config is what makes InSpatial apps look the way they do! However if you find yourself doing this, you might want to consider removing the InSpatial Tailwind Config package and only using it as a guide to build your own.
