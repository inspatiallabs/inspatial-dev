IMPORTANT - Before any implementation always fully explore and understand the context of the existing codebase. 

IMPORTANT - Never write code immediately on every propmt always deeply understand what's currently happening first.

IMPORTANT - Spend a minimum of 1 minutes up to a max of 10 minutes to deeply reason about how a world-class engineer would approach solving the problem. 

IMPORTANT - Generate ideas, critique them, refine your thinking, and then propose an excellent final plan. I'll approve or request changes before implentation.

IMPORTANT - Always understand the environment you are operating in to reduce risk of hallucination if you do not understand ask before making any implmentation.
