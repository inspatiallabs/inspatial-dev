## 🙏 Credits & Acknowledgments

_**"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."** — Isaac Newton_

---

InSpatial Dev exists because of the incredible open source community and the brilliant minds who've shared their work with the world. This project is built on the foundation of exceptional tools, frameworks, and ideas that have shaped modern software development.

We believe in **giving credit where credit is due** and supporting the ecosystem that makes innovation possible. While we've charted our own course to maintain control over our direction and roadmap, we're deeply grateful for the inspiration, mental models, and technical excellence provided by these projects.

---

## 🏗️ **Core Foundation**

### **🦕 [Deno](https://deno.land/)**
*The modern runtime that powers our TypeScript-first development experience*

Deno's security-first approach, built-in TypeScript support, and modern web standards compatibility form the backbone of InSpatial Dev's development environment.

### **🎯 [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)** & **[RefUI](https://github.com/SudoMaker/rEFui)**
*Reactive primitives that inspired our signal architecture and rendering*

SolidJS and RefUI demonstrated that reactive programming can achieve both high performance and intuitive design. Their fine-grained reactivity models profoundly shaped our approach to signal-based state management and DOM rendering philosophies.


---

## 🎨 **Design & User Experience**


### **📱 [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org/)**
*Cross-platform development innovation*

NativeScript’s groundbreaking approach to delivering truly native cross-platform experiences—while letting developers stay in the familiar world of JavaScript—feels like pure magic. Their technology is so effective, it forms the backbone of our native renderers.

---

## 🔧 **Developer Tooling & Infrastructure**

### **🏷️ [ArkType](https://arktype.io/)**
*Runtime type validation done right*

ArkType's refined approach to runtime type validation impressed us so much, we made an exception to our no-dependency rule just to include it.

### **🌟 [Pmndrs](https://pmnd.rs/)**
*The creative collective pushing boundaries in web graphics*

The Pmndrs ecosystem (Three.js, React Three Fiber, React Three XR, etc...) has been instrumental in shaping our approach to 3D graphics and spatial computing. 

### **🎬 [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/)**
*Smooth animations that bring interfaces to life*

Anime.js showed us that animations can be both elegant and efficient, inspiring our own motion and animation systems to the extent that all we needed was a TypeScript adaptation.

---

## 🤖 **AI & Machine Learning**

### **🧠 [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)**
*Advancing the frontier of artificial intelligence*

OpenAI's APIs and models power many of our intelligent features and development tools.

### **🔮 [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)**
*Constitutional AI and helpful, harmless, honest principles*

Anthropic's approach to AI safety and helpful AI systems influences how we integrate AI capabilities responsibly.

---

## 💖 **Our Commitment to Open Source**

We understand that we can't acknowledge every project that has influenced our work—the open source ecosystem is vast and interconnected. Here's how we're giving back:

- **🎯 Active Sponsorship**: We sponsor open source projects that power our development
- **🔄 Contributing Back**: We contribute improvements, bug fixes, and features upstream
- **📖 Knowledge Sharing**: We open source our own innovations when possible
