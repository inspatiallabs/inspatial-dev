## 🔄 Core Contribution Workflow

### 1️⃣ Setting Up Your Environment
```bash
# Fork the repository and clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/InSpatial-Core.git

# Add the upstream repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/InSpatial/InSpatial-Core.git
```

### 2️⃣ Working on Features
```bash
# Create a new branch off the relevant domain branch
git checkout -b cloud-ben cloud-main

# Commit changes regularly with descriptive messages
git commit -m "feat(cloud): add feature X to cloud module"
```

### 3️⃣ Syncing with Upstream
```bash
# Sync your branch with the latest changes from the domain branch
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/cloud-main
```

### 4️⃣ Creating a Pull Request
```bash
# Push your branch to GitHub
git push origin cloud-ben
```

Then:
1. Open a pull request (PR) from your branch to the domain branch
2. Format your PR:
   - **Title**: `feat(domain): short description`
   - **Description**: Include details, screenshots, or diagrams
   - **Reviewers**: Assign domain maintainers

### 5️⃣ Git Commit + Messages

### 🔍 Review and Approval Process

#### Code Review Guidelines
- **Self-Review Checklist**:
  - ✓ Code readability and standards compliance
  - ✓ Comprehensive testing (manual and automated)
  - ✓ Documentation updates if needed
  
- **Peer Review Focus**:
  - ✓ Functionality validation
  - ✓ Style adherence
  - ✓ Performance implications
  - ✓ Security considerations

#### Merging Process
1. Domain maintainer reviews and approves PR
2. PR gets merged into domain branch (e.g., `cloud-main`)
3. Once stable, domain maintainer:
   - Creates PR to `main`
   - Coordinates final reviews
   - Handles merge to production



## 🌳 Branching Strategy

### Domain Ownership and Decision Making
Each domain in InSpatial Core has explicit ownership and decision-making authority:

| Domain | Owner | Responsibilities |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Cloud | @cloud-maintainer | Final decisions on cloud infrastructure, deployment, and scaling |
| Store | @store-maintainer | Final decisions on marketplace features and integrations |
| Dev | @dev-maintainer | Final decisions on developer experience and tooling |
| App | @app-maintainer | Final decisions on app features and integrations |

- Domain owners are core-maintainers and have final say on:
  - Feature acceptance/rejection
  - Architecture decisions
  - Breaking changes
  - Release timing
  - Technical direction
- External Contributors should:
  - Align proposals with domain owner's vision
  - Seek early feedback on major changes
  - Respect domain-specific guidelines
  - Direct domain-specific questions to respective owners

### Branch Hierarchy
```
main (production)
├── cloud-main
│   ├── cloud-ben
│   └── cloud-eli
├── store-main
│   ├── store-sam
│   └── store-alex
└── dev-main
    ├── dev-jay
    └── dev-kim
```

### Branch Naming
1. **`main`**  
   The stable, production-ready branch. Changes here are fully tested and reviewed.
2. **Domain Branches (e.g., `cloud-main`, `store-main`, `dev-main`, `app-main`)**  
   Each domain has its own branch for consolidating features and updates. These branches are owned by a designated domain maintainer.
3. **Individual Branches (e.g., `cloud-ben`, `cloud-eli`)**  
   Individual contributors use these branches to develop features or experiment. 
4. **Hotfix Branches (e.g., `hotfix-123`)**  
   These branches are used to fix critical bugs in the `main` branch. They are created from the `main` branch and merged back into it.
